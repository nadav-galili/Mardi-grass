            <p>The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including the city of New Orleans.
                Celebrations
                are concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday
                (the
                start of lent in the Western Christian tradition). Usually there is one major parade each day (weather
                permitting); many days have several large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take place the
                last five days of the Mardi Gras season. In the final week, many events occur throughout New Orleans and
                surrounding communities, including parades and balls (some of them masquerade balls).

                The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow the same parade
                schedule and route each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the
                earliest,
                Rex, the Knights of Momus and the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super krewes" are well known for
                holding
                large parades and events, such as the Krewe of Endymion (which is best known for naming celebrities as
                grand
                marshals for their parades), the Krewe of Bacchus (similarly known for naming celebrities as their
                Kings),
                as well as the Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Club—a predominantly African American krewe. Float riders
                traditionally toss throws into the crowds. The most common throws are strings of colorful plastic beads,
                doubloons, decorated plastic "throw cups", Moon Pies, and small inexpensive toys, but throws can also
                include lingerie and more sordid items. Major krewes follow the same parade schedule and route each
                year.

        <p>While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street and in New Orleans and
            Dauphin,<br> major parades originate in the Uptown and Mid-City districts and follow a route along St. Charles
            Avenue and Canal Street, on the upriver side of the French Quarter. Mardi Gras day traditionally concludes
            with the "Meeting of the Courts" between Rex and Comus.[1]</p>

                alt="girl in parade"><br><br>
            <p>The first record of Mardi Gras being celebrated in Louisiana was at the mouth of the Mississippi River in
                what is now lower Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, on March 2, 1699. Iberville, Bienville, and their men
                celebrated it as part of an observance of Catholic practice. The date of the first celebration of the
                festivities in New Orleans is unknown. A 1730 account by Marc-Antione Caillot celebrating with music and
                dance, masking and costuming (including cross-dressing). Excerpt | A Company Man - The Book An account
                from
                1743 that the custom of Carnival balls was already established. Processions and wearing of masks in the
                streets on Mardi Gras took place. They were sometimes prohibited by law, and were quickly renewed
                whenever
                such restrictions were lifted or enforcement waned. In 1833 Bernard Xavier de Marigny de Mandeville, a
                rich
                plantation owner of French descent, raised money to fund an official Mardi Gras celebration.
                In 1856 21 businessmen gathered at a club room in the French Quarter to organize a secret society to
                observe
                Mardi Gras with a formal parade. They founded New Orleans' first and oldest krewe, the Mystick Krewe of
                Comus. According to one historian, "Comus was aggressively English in its celebration of what New
                Orleans
                had always considered a French festival. It is hard to think of a clearer assertion than this parade
                that
                the lead in the holiday had passed from French-speakers to Anglo-Americans. ... To a certain extent,
                Americans 'Americanized' New Orleans and its Creoles. To a certain extent, New Orleans 'creolized' the
                Americans. Thus the wonder of Anglo-Americans boasting of how their business prowess helped them
                construct a
                more elaborate version than was traditional. The lead in organized Carnival passed from Creole to
                American
                just as political and economic power did over the course of the nineteenth century. The spectacle of
                Creole-American Carnival, with Americans using Carnival forms to compete with Creoles in the ballrooms
                and
                on the streets, represents the creation of a New Orleans culture neither entirely Creole nor entirely
                American."[3]

        <H2>Corona virus pandemic</H2>
        <p>Unknown to the participants and local leaders at the time, the 2020 Carnival season (with parades running
            from January through Mardi Gras Day on February 25) coincided with increasing spread of coronavirus disease
            2019 (COVID-19) in the United States as part of a global pandemic.[11] At the time, the disease was actively
            being dismissed as a major public health threat by the Trump administration.[12] As such, federal officials
            did not advise against the holding of Mardi Gras festivities, and scrutiny over mass public gatherings and
            events that induce international tourism had yet to emerge.[11] The first case of COVID-19 in Louisiana was
            reported on March 9, two weeks after the end of Mardi Gras.[13]

            Subsequently, the state of Louisiana saw a significant impact from the pandemic, with New Orleans in
            particular seeing a high rate of cases. Louisiana State University (LSU) associate professor Susanne
            Straif-Bourgeoi suggested that the rapid spread may have been aided by Mardi Gras festivities.[14][15][14]
            Researchers of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette estimated that Louisiana had the fastest growth rate
            of cases (67.8%, overtaking overtaking New York's 66.1% growth) in the 14 days since its first reported case
            than any region in the world.[16][14]

            Mayor LaToya Cantrell stated that she would have cancelled Mardi Gras festivities had she been provided with
            sufficient warning by the federal government, and criticized the Trump administration for downplaying the
            threat.[11][17] Given the progression of the pandemic, it is still undetermined as to whether or not Mardi
            Gras will take place in 2021. [18] Krewes are hopeful to roll in 2021 but are prepared for 2022 if they are
            not able to. [19]</p>

            <p>LaToya Cantrell (born April 3, 1972) is an American politician serving as the Mayor of New Orleans,
                Louisiana, a post she has held since May 7, 2018. Cantrell, a Democrat, is the first black woman to hold
                the post.
                Before becoming mayor, Cantrell represented District B on the New Orleans City Council from
                2012–2018.
                Cantrell was born as LaToya Wilder in Los Angeles. She moved to New Orleans in 1990 to attend Xavier
                University of Louisiana, where she earned a BA in sociology.[3] She attended an executive training
                program
                at the Harvard Kennedy School.<br>
                Cantrell declared her candidacy for mayor of New Orleans in March 2017 in a race to replace term-limited
                mayor Mitch Landrieu.[23] An open primary was held on October 14 and included 18 candidates. Cantrell
                garnered the most votes, winning 39% of the total.[24] In the November 18 runoff election, Cantrell
                defeated fellow Democratic opponent Desiree Charbonnet, a former municipal judge, with 60% of the vote.
                She is the first woman to lead New Orleans in its 300-year history,[25][26] as well as the first mayor
                not born in the city since Vic Schiro.[27]

            Mayor of New Orleans
            Cantrell was inaugurated as mayor on May 7, 2018, the first woman to hold the position in the city's
            history.[28] Once in office, she established a new Office of Youth and Families, with the goal of creating a
            strategic plan to address families in crisis in the city. Cantrell also founded a Gun Violence Reduction
            Council tasked with finding solutions to violent crime.[29] Starting with a push to rededicate hotel taxes
            collected within the city for city use, Cantrell has focused on her #fairshare initiative to improve city
            infrastructure, public transportation, public parks, and green spaces.[30] As part of that initiative, in
            October 2018 the City of New Orleans filed a lawsuit against four opioid manufactures and distributors.
